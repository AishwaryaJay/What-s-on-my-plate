# What-s-on-my-plate
Task tracking app using mobile camera.

PROJECT NAME:    
What's on my plate?

Developed the app using the PhoneGap framework, Javascript and HTML5.

DESCRIPTION:       
 Allows users to store a picture-based to-do list and also note down related information about their errands. This serves as a visual reminder system. Instead of typing in and going through a long list, it would be easier for the users to just take pictures or go through a set of pictures on their to-do list. 

Examples: 

Students could take a picture of a borrowed library book and next to the picture they could note down the due date or a link to the library website for renewal.
Users who wants to add 'Car wash' to their to-do list could just store a picture of their car using the app instead.

Features used:
